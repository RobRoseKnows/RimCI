# RimCI

This repository demonstrates a barebone, but fully functional, RimWorld mod being built using **GitHub Actions** on **Windows**, **Ubuntu** and **MacOS**.

It currently has one workflow called **Build** that builds the mod in all three environments upon **Git Push**.

The workflow configuration can be found in .github/workflows/main.yaml.

The result of the workflow is under **Actions**.
